 * Following a completely redesigned approach and thinking in different ways of
 * improving time performance I concluded that a parallel execution had to be
 * integrated. With that, I had two alternatives using worker threads of Node.js
 * or the RxJs library that I already had some experience with in the past,
 * especially with streams, with some minor research and going back to the
 * RxJS documentation I found a better way to handle all processes in
 * parallel making the time execution way less than with the Min-Heap.
 * This is possible by the use of observables that allow to handle the
 * data in streams. and then process them simultaneously.
